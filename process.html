          <h4>Idea</h4>
          <p>
            Our client, Heba Alhosainy, came to Nebulosa with an idea to create
            an online education platform. She had researched existing platforms
            and realized they either allowed students to talk with a tutor
            one-on-one or buy courses. So Heba decided to create a platform for
            offline as well as online education where students could both
            purchase courses and book online lessons with tutors.
          </p>

          <p>
            Heba asked Steelkiwi team to analyze what features were necessary
            for such an app, identify possible gaps in the business logic,
            create a design, and build the website itself.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="service-txt mb-100">
          <h4>Analysis</h4>
          <p>
            According to Statista, the global online education market is
            forecasted to exceed $243 billion by 2022, whereas in 2016, it
            amounted to only $46.67 billion. With online education platforms,
            tutors can share their expertise and create courses for the whole
            world. Students, in turn, can study comfortably and affordably. They
            can also access courses from famous universities and tutors.
          </p>

          <p>
            Employers that invest in educating their staff see 218% greater
            income per employee and 24% higher profit margins than those that
            don’t, according to the Darlo Group. Online education also allows
            businesses to reduce costs on lecturers, travel, hotels, and
            equipment.
          </p>

          <p>
            People want to learn new things not only for work but also for
            hobbies and general competence. Thus, there’s demand for niche and
            global platforms such as YoTutors..
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="service-txt">
          <h4>Solution</h4>
          <p>
            We built an online platform where students can book online lessons
            with tutors and buy courses. To find the perfect tutor, students can
            use filters such as subject, price, availability, location, and
            gender. YoTutors is designed for tutors too. To get started, they
            sign up as tutors and provide details including a brief introduction
            about themselves, experience, communication channel, introduction
            video, subject/subjects that they teach, resume, and schedule .

              <h5>Crafted the user experience</h5>
              <p>
                Before starting development, we went over the project’s business
                logic, examined the documents our client already had, researched
                the competition, and identified the best functionality offered
                by competitors to include in our client’s app. We then drew
                pages and went through all sections of the website using the
                User Flows approach, meaning we focused on what users need to
                get done on YoTutors (for example, purchasing a course) and how
                to deliver that in the most effective way. The User Flows
                approach helped us see whether there were any logical mistakes.
              </p>

              <p>
                For lessons, our client decided not to make video calls directly
                via the platform but instead to use existing video chat apps
                like Skype, Hangouts, and Zoom. For the first version of the
                YoTutors website, implementing video call functionality would
                have taken too much development time and increased the budget.

                navigation, and made the user interface a reality with the help
                of forms, colors, fonts, and other visual elements approved by
                the client.
              </p>

              <p>
                Our client suggested that we use dark blue as the main color and
                a brave orange for emphasis. We used these colors and created an
                easy-to-use, modern, and intuitive product that conveys the
                essence and value of the product. The image on the main page
                represents the diversity of subjects that can be explored on
                YoTutors.

                overall concept was to combine the two main letters in YoTutors:
                Y and T. We offered different options for the logo and
                background colors and selected the font for the YoTutors name.
                Our client reviewed every option we offered and approved the
                final design.

              <p>
                Integrating the Braintree SDK into PayPal <br />
                Our client wanted to make payments through PayPal so users could
                pay from their YoTutors accounts without being redirected to the
                website of a payment gateway.
              </p>

              <p>
                PayPal doesn’t allow you to add your own payment form on not a
                PayPal site. Braintree does allow you to integrate your own
                payment form on your own site so that users can pay without
                being redirected. This works if a customer pays one service
                provider directly. But the YoTutors platform is a marketplace,
                as lessons and courses are provided by different tutors.
              </p>

              <p>
                Braintree started providing functionality for such use cases not
                so long ago. Yet there were several barriers to implementing
                Braintree Marketplace. First, Braintree Marketplace isn’t
                available everywhere, and the YoTutors platforms aimed to
                function all over the world. Secondly, to use Braintree
                Marketplace, you have to contact the Braintree sales team and
                introduce your project – and the project has to meet several
                requirements. For example, it should already have been working
                for several months, be actively making payments to service
                providers, and have a monthly turnover of over $10,000. Our
                client’s startup didn’t meet these requirements. In the end, we
                decided to implement card payments using PayPal with no
                redirecting.

                Synchronizing Google calendar with the YoTutors calendar We
                encountered a problem when connecting to Google Calendar and
                trying to synchronize the YoTutors calendar with it. An API
                didn’t return the code necessary to authorize and connect to
                Google Calendar. To solve this, we used react-google-login, a
                third-party library.

                Choosing an HTML editor to edit course content We reviewed
                several editors and opted for Draft.js, a flexible editor.

                Time zones <br />
                Working with time zones is always a challenge. In our case, the
                problem was with displaying the list of tutors with their
                schedules in the time zone of an authorized user or the time
                zone of the browser of an unauthorized user. To solve this
                issue, we used the pytz Python library..
